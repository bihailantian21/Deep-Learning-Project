# Deep-Learning-Final-Project
The project is implementation of two different research papers and comparing their performance to each other as well as to the original paper.

## Research papers used
1. A Dual-Stage Attention-Based Recurrent Neural Network for Time Series Prediction
https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02971

2. Hierarchical Attention-Based Recurrent Highway Networks for Time Series Prediction
https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00685

## Dataset
Here we have used a timeseries dataset of NASDAQ stock data of 105 trading days from 26th July,2016 to December 22,2016

## Libraries/Tools Used
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Pytorch
4. Matplotlib
5. Jupyter Notebook

## Results achieved
Here we are getting results close to the original paper but still needs some work to replicate exact same results as the researcch paper

## Running the notebook
Use the dataset given in the repository and follow the along the notebook.
